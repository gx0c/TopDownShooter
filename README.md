# TopDownShooter

Its a simple android game prototype made using 
<a href="https://libgdx.com/">LibGDX</a>
in a <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity_component_system">ECS (Entity-Component-System)</a>
Architecture.

# Note

This thing is on my storage for quite some time now so i thought i'd share it and
this is my first time trying <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity_component_system">ECS (Entity-Component-System)</a>
so the code is really ugly.
