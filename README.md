# TopDownShooter

Its a simple android game prototype made using 
<a href="https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/">LibGDX</a>
and <a href="https://github.com/libgdx/ashley">Ashley</a>.

# Note

This thing is on my storage for quite some time now so i thought i'd share it and
this is my first time trying to do <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity_component_system">ECS</a>
so the code is really ugly.
